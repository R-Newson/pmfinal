                Quality management in healthcare is a systematic approach to ensuring that healthcare services are safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable. It involves setting standards for care, measuring performance against those standards, and making improvements where necessary.

                Quality, in the traditional sense, relates to whether a product or service satisfies the customer by meeting expected characteristics. However, in the context of healthcare, quality definition takes a more complex form. Not only must healthcare services satisfy the consumer – in this case, the patient – but they must also meet a strict set of criteria to ensure they meet the highest possible standards and protocols.

                <li><strong>Hospital Readmission Rate:</strong> Monitoring how often patients return to the hospital shortly after discharge helps assess the effectiveness of care and patient outcomes.</li>
